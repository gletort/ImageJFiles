## Choose Roi

### Select "best" Roi
When there are several Rois by z-slice, select only one "best" Roi for each slice.
For example, select for each z-slice the Roi that have the highest area among all Rois that are present in each z-slice.
Delete the non-selected Rois.

### Keep specific Rois
Keep all Rois that have a desired property (e.g. circularity between two given values).
