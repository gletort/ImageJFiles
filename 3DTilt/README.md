# 3D Tilt
Plugin to create 3D movie of a z-stacks. Allows for a nice visualisation giving a 3D effect of the stack.

From [ekatrukha](https://gist.github.com/ekatrukha) [3D_Tilt](https://gist.github.com/ekatrukha/815c2a739262afe5649682a670ea7c05.js) macro, but in a plugin version (faster).

Can also handle hyperstacks.
